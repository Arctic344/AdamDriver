# PCA9685_MotorDriver
I created a compact quad-motor driver for a project

It uses a PCA9685 PWM controller and two TB6612FNG chips to run up to 4 motors from 4.5V to 13.5V

It is functionally the same as [this arduino shield](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-shield-v2-for-arduino/overview), but without the servo drivers and such.

Please note that this is my first PCB project, and as such, this is by far not optimal and probably has bugs, weird stuff, common errors. I suggest you DO NOT use this unless you actually know what ive created, because I myself do not know

If for some reason you have a question about this stuff, add me @arctic344 on discord.

This is a test to see if git commands work.s
