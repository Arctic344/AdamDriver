# AdamDriver, the PCA9685 based MotorDriver
I created a compact quad-motor driver for a project

It uses a PCA9685 PWM controller and two TB6612FNG chips to run up to 4 motors from 4.5V to 13.5V

It is functionally the same as [this arduino shield](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-shield-v2-for-arduino/overview), but without the servo drivers and such.

I dont know what I am doing, so please do not attempt to use this driver.

If for some reason you have a question about this stuff, add me @arctic344 on discord.
